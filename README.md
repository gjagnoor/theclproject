Inspired by the `tree` cli tool in windows, `aaria-cli` is a recursive directory/file listing cli program that produces a depth indented listing of folders/files in your system

# Highlights

- highly performant
- clean and focused

# Install

```
npm i aaria-cli -g
```

# Usage 

using your terminal `cd` into the folder of your choice

to view a recursive list of directories in the folder, run: 

```
aaria type=d
```

to view a recursive list of directories and files in the folder, run:

```
aaria type=f
```

Note: if you don't specify a `type` command, program defaults to listing all directories recursively. Files will not be listed
